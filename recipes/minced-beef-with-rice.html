            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Wash and cook rice</b></p>
                    <p>Wash the rice (14 oz) three times, gently swirling the grains around to remove any dust. Use fresh water with each round.</p>                   
                    <p>Add the rice and water (14 oz) to the inner rice cooker pot. Place the pot in the cooker, then activate it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Marinade beef</b></p>
                    <p>Add the ground beef (8 oz) to one side of a medium bowl.</p>
                    <p>Add the cornstarch (1 tablespoon), oyster sauce (1 tablespoon), white pepper (0.13 teaspoon) and water (2 tablespoon) to the other side of the bowl. Mix together the seasonings first to create a marinade before combining it with the beef.</p>
                    <p>Once the marinade comes together, use a spoon to mix it into the beef until it's all incorporated.</p>
                    <p>Add the oil (2 teaspoon), then mix it into the beef.</p>
                    <p>(Chef's Tip: Adding oil to the beef here will prevent it from clumping later during cooking.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Dice green onions</b></p>
                    <p>Cut off the bottoms and dice just the white parts of the green onions (1 oz).</p>
                    <p>(Chef's Tip: Use the remaining green parts for other recipes such as our Ginger Scallion Sauce and Ginger Scallion Noodles!)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Prep sauce</b></p>
                    <p>In a small bowl, combine the oyster sauce (1 tablespoon), light soy sauce (1 tablespoon), dark soy sauce (1 teaspoon), cooking wine (2 teaspoon), and chicken bouillon powder (1 teaspoon). Mix until thoroughly combined</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Prep slurry</b></p>
                    <p>In a small bowl, combine the potato starch (2.5 teaspoon) and water (4 teaspoon) and mix to thoroughly combine.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Plate rice and add egg</b></p>
                    <p>Scoop the cooked rice onto a large rimmed plate, shaping it into a mound while still hot.</p>
                    <p>Wet the egg (1 large) with a bit of water and place it in the middle of the plated rice to make an indent.</p>
                    <p>Crack the egg into the indent.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Cook beef</b></p>
                    <p>Heat the wok on high for about 1 minute. Once the wok is smoking, decrease the heat and add the oil (1 tablespoon), spreading it all over sides of wok with a spatula.</p>
                    <p>Decrease the heat to low and add the beef. Break it apart with the spatula and flip, about 1 to 1.5 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Add the diced green onions and stir fry with the beef for about 1 minute. Make sure to continue breaking up the beef, if needed.</p>
                    <p>Pour the cooking wine (1 tablespoon) around the edge of the wok and stir fry about 10 to 20 seconds.</p>
                    <p>Add the hot water (1.5 cup), slowly pouring it along the edge of the wok. Add the sauce, followed by the green peas (2 oz).</p>
                    <p>Turn the heat back on to high and cook for 30 to 40 seconds.</p>
                    <p>Lower the heat to medium and pour in the slurry while mixing the sauce (add less or more slurry to get desired consistency).</p>
                    <p>Add the finishing oil (1 tablespoon) and sesame oil (1 teaspoon). With the heat back on high, stir fry to mix everything thoroughly for 30 to 40 seconds. Add the finishing dark soy sauce (0.50 teaspoon) for additional color.</p>
                    <p>Use a ladle to add the minced beef on top of the plated rice, leaving the egg in the center uncovered.</p>
