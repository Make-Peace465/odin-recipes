    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>rep chicken</b></p>
            <p>In a large bowl, dissolve the salt (1 teaspoon) into the water (2 cup). Fully submerge the chicken breast (1 lb) in the water for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Brining the chicken will help keep it nice and juicy. Generally, the longer, the better, but don't go more than 24 hours.</p>
            <p>Once you're done brining, remove the chicken from the water. Slice the chicken against the grain into 3 equal-sized pieces. Next, slice at an angle to create 1-inch thick chicken cutlets. Finally, use the back of your knife to lightly pound both sides of the chicken. This will help tenderize the meat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Prep marinade</b></p>
            <p>In a medium bowl, add the oyster sauce (2 tablespoon), light soy sauce (2 teaspoon), cooking wine (1 tablespoon), sugar (1 teaspoon), salt (0.50 teaspoon), white pepper (0.25 teaspoon), cornstarch (2 tablespoon) and grated ginger (0.50 oz). Mix thoroughly to combine. Add the chicken breast and use your hands to massage the marinade into the meat.</p>
            <p>Chef's Tip: To turn the ginger into a grated paste, my dad uses his knife. Cut the ginger into thin slices, then use a slap and pull motion to pulverize the ginger. Mince the paste to cut through any remaining fibers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Prep aromatics</b></p>
            <p>On a separate cutting board, slice the white onion into 1/4-inch strips going along the grain. My dad prefers to cut this way to help the strips stay intact.</p>
            <p>Slice the red onion into 1/4-inch strips, also going along the grain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Make sauce</b></p>
            <p>In a small bowl, combine the oyster sauce (1 tablespoon), light soy sauce (2 teaspoon), sugar (2 teaspoon), chicken bouillon powder (1 teaspoon), cornstarch (1 teaspoon), water (3 tablespoon) and cooking wine (1 tablespoon). Stir to thoroughly mix.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Pan fry chicken</b></p>       
            <p>Spread the cornstarch (3 tablespoon) out on a plate and coat each piece of chicken cutlet on both sides. This helps seal in the juices.</p>
            <p>Heat up a flat bottom pan on high for 1 to 2 minutes on high heat. Add the oil (3 oz) and let it heat up for 30 seconds to 1 minute.</p>
            <p>Turn the heat down to a medium low. Start laying in your cutlets one at a time. Fry the cutlets for 3 minutes before flipping. A nice browned crust should have formed. Once flipped, fry for 1 more minute. The chicken is done once the internal temperature reaches 165Â°F.</p>
            <p>Add all of the sliced white onions to the pan and half of the sliced red onions to the pan, making sure to spread them out. Decrease the heat to low.</p>
            <p>Pour the cooking wine (1 teaspoon) around the edge of the pan. Cover the pan for 30 seconds.</p>
            <p>Add the sauce, pouring it over the chicken. If needed, move the chicken around to make sure each piece gets coated in the sauce.</p>
            <p>Add the sesame oil (1 teaspoon). Garnish with the remaining red onions.</p>
            <p>To plate, place the chicken on your serving platter, followed by the onions.</p>
